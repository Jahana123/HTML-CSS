<h1> LIKE NATURE <br> <span> BE CREATIVE!</span></h1><br>
            <p>
                Nature is made of everything we see around us â€“ trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests and more. Human beings depend on nature to stay alive. Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothes. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.
                Animals, fish and insects also get their food and shelter from nature. Different trees grow up due to sunlight and water provided by nature. Humans should stop causing harm to the elements of nature for their needs. Nature is very important to maintain the growth and balance of life on earth. 
                Every member of the living world obtains its life support from nature. Nature guides the cycling of air, water and life between the different constituents or spheres on Earth. The treasures in nature not only provide for our basic requirements of survival but also fuel the raw materials to support factories and industries on which the modern world primarily runs . 
                
              <p>  By using eco-friendly products and discarding plastic and other non-degradable materials, we are doing a huge favour to our nature. We can also join our hands to reduce pollution by segregating wastes, using public transport and avoiding the use of pesticides.</p>
